# html-css-js-website
 A website that i created in 2018 when i was learning web development and stuff.

i didn't know so much about web development but i tried really hard on making a different and good looking website, i'm really proud of myself since i remember it was a little bit hard to learn javascript when almost everyone wasn't using at all.

As you can see, almost all the content are in portuguese since i'm from Brazil and in that time i wasn't really worried about it but i plan to remove the images (bc they probably are licensed) and translate to english. 

Also, feel free to copy the code or fork it and pull a request :)

## How do i run it?

it's really simple, you only need to download the repository and run index.html and you are ready to run it.
